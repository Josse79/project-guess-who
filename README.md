# Project Name
Guess who project with characters in an array - learning arrays and objects.
The assignment was to set a a secret person by method 'Math random" and then choose questions from a drop down in HTLM. Filtering out the remaining characters based on the secret persons category and value. Giving proper alerts in correct sections of HTML.

## The problem
First part of the week I spent to read up on arrays and objects. Then i followed the STEPS very carefully. I consoled log the secret person to be able to check the questions and alerts.
I tried to invent the approach by myself at first, if not working I googled, checked into other peoples code and searched for SO questions by filtering Guess who tag.
Since this is difficult to learn I planned to only do the basics / needs for the blue requirements and not to spend time on styling.
If I had more time I would have add a counter.
